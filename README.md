adapt-contrib-media
===================

A basic media component that plays audio and video. This component uses the HTML5 audio and video specification and has a Flash/Silverlight alternative for browsers that don't support HTML5.

The component uses [MediaElement.js](http://mediaelementjs.com/) (v2.13.1) which enables users, amongst other things, to offer subtitles and accessible, skinnable (with CSS) controls. MediaElement.js carries an MIT license and is therefore compatible with Adapt.
	
IMPORTANT: MediaElement.js v2.13.1 requires a small patch to enable it to work in IE8 when used in conjuction with Adapt.
